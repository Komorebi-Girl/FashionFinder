# FashionFinder

## What is it? 
Fashion-Finder is a simple web application I created to practice using the server framework Express.js. Essentially, It's an app that matches the user with a new store to shop at based on their survey results. 

## Why did I create such a thing?  
I was inspired to build Fashion-Finder for two simple reasons: One, taking quizzes online is a favorite pastime nowadays (I
mean, who doesn't spend hours on BuzzFeed taking quizzes to find out which character they are on Friends or which
members of The Avengers is their soulmate?). Two, I love trying out new styles every now and then but I have nothing short of sheer disdain for the process of searching through the mall for hours on end for a place to shop that suits my tastes. One day I thought to myself, "Wouldn't it be great if I could take a quiz that would identify my sense of style and recommend a new place for me to shop?" Thus, Fashion-Finder was born!
